Berners-Lee was born on 8 June 1955 in London, England,[26] the eldest of the four children of Mary Lee Woods and Conway Berners-Lee
Sir Tim Berners-Lee invented the World Wide Web in 1989.
 He is the co-founder and CTO of Inrupt.com, a tech start-up which uses, promotes and helps develop the open source Solid platform.
 Solid aims to give people control and agency over their data, questioning many assumptions about how the web has to work.
 He attended Sheen Mount Primary School, and then went on to attend south-west London's Emanuel School from 1969 to 1973,
 at the time a direct grant grammar school, which became an independent school in 1975.
